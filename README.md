# Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` Listener Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a bug and its solution related to the inconsistent triggering of the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener.  The bug showcases scenarios where the listener might not accurately reflect changes in the user's authentication state, potentially leading to unexpected application behavior. The solution provides a more robust approach to handling authentication status updates.

## Bug Description

The `onAuthStateChanged` listener in the Firebase SDK, while generally reliable, may sometimes fail to consistently update the UI with the current authentication status. This can occur due to various factors, such as network connectivity issues or inconsistencies in how different devices handle events.  This may lead to security vulnerabilities or UI glitches where the app's state doesn't match the actual user authentication status. 

## Solution

The provided solution implements a more reliable approach to handling authentication state changes, including a robust error-handling mechanism and more resilient event-listening strategies.
