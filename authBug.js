The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger consistently across different network conditions or device configurations. This can lead to unexpected behavior where authentication status changes are not reflected in your application, even though the user's authentication state has actually changed. For example, a user might sign out successfully on the server but the application still displays the UI as if the user is logged in.
